Dataset acquired during a training session organised by Singapore Bioimaging Consortium for King's College London BRAIN staff.

Two male mice (30-34 g, 15-20 weeks old), were imaged on a 11.75T (Bruker 117/16), 72 mm volume coil, 2x2 phased array cryocoil, using Paravision 6.0.1. 

A T2 turboRARE sequence was used to obtain anatomical. A single-shot gradient echo EPI sequence was use to record fMRI. 

Animals were mechanically ventilated, anesthetized with isoflurane 0.5% in 1:1 medical air and O2 mix together with medetomidine 0.1 mg/kg/h and pancuronium bromide administered s.c. , as in Grandjean et al. 2014 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25175535).
